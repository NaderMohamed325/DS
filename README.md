Stack and Queue Implementation in C
Overview
This project contains an implementation of the stack and queue data structures in C. These data structures are fundamental in computer science and software engineering and are essential for managing data in a last-in, first-out (LIFO) or first-in, first-out (FIFO) manner.

Data Structures Implemented
This project includes the following data structures:

Stack: The stack is a LIFO data structure. You can use it for various applications, such as function call management, expression evaluation, and more.

Queue: The queue is a FIFO data structure. It is commonly used for managing tasks, scheduling, and other scenarios where tasks need to be processed in the order they are received.

Prerequisites
Before using or contributing to this project, ensure that you have the following prerequisites:

C compiler (e.g., GCC)
Make sure to have a basic understanding of C programming.
Getting Started
Clone the repository to your local machine:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/stack-and-queue-in-c.git
Compile the code:

bash
Copy code
cd stack-and-queue-in-c
make
Run the program:

bash
Copy code
./main
Usage
Stack
You can use the stack data structure by including the "stack.h" header in your C code. Example:

c
Copy code
#include "stack.h"

int main() {
    Stack* stack = createStack(10); // Create a stack with a maximum capacity of 10 elements.
    // Use stack operations here...
    return 0;
}
For specific usage instructions and examples, refer to the comments and documentation in "stack.c" and "stack.h".

Queue
You can use the queue data structure by including the "queue.h" header in your C code. Example:

c
Copy code
#include "queue.h"

int main() {
    Queue* queue = createQueue(10); // Create a queue with a maximum capacity of 10 elements.
    // Use queue operations here...
    return 0;
}
For specific usage instructions and examples, refer to the comments and documentation in "queue.c" and "queue.h".
