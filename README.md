Data Structures Implementation READMEIntroductionThis repository showcases various data structures implemented in Python. Data structures are essential elements in computer science for efficiently managing and organizing data. In this project, you will find clean and effective implementations of commonly used data structures.Data Structures ImplementedLinked List: A basic singly-linked list with operations like insertion, deletion, and traversal.Stack: A simple stack implementation with push and pop operations.Queue: A basic queue with enqueue and dequeue operations.Binary Search Tree: An implementation of a binary search tree with insertion, deletion, and traversal methods.Hash Table: A simple hash table with key-value storage and basic collision handling.Heap: A binary min-heap implementation with insert and extract-min operations.Graph: An adjacency list representation of a graph with basic graph traversal algorithms (BFS, DFS).How to UseTo utilize these data structures in your Python projects:Clone this repository to your local machine.Import the specific data structure you need in your Python code:from data_structures import LinkedListEmploy the methods provided by the data structure for your specific needs.# Example usage of a linked list
linked_list = LinkedList()
linked_list.append(42)
linked_list.append(100)
linked_list.print_list()  # Output: 42 -> 100Reference the documentation and comments within the source code for comprehensive details on each data structure and their usage.ContributingContributions to this project are encouraged.
